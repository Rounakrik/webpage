## Research Interests

I am a final year BS-MS student at IISER Bhopal. My research interests lie in **Nuclear Astrophysics**, **Compact Objects**, and **Cosmology**. I am interested in the Theoritical aspects of understanding the natural phenomenon in the extremes domains of gravitation. Along with this I have a keen interest in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and I want to implement these computaional tools to uncover the physical processes in nature.
